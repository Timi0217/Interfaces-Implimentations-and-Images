Program Creators: Timi Dayo-Kayode and Favour Okereke-Mba

We received help from the TA's; specifically Ashton, Chris, Matt and Harrison. 
The only other collaborators that we are aware of are ourselves.

We have correctly implemented the interface for UArray2_T, Bit2_t abstarct data 
structures. We have also correctly implemented sudoku.c and unblackedges.c to 
the best of our knowledge and as specified by the homework. 

We spent approximately 25 hours completing this assignment, including going 
over the specs and reading up useful Hanson's ADS.
