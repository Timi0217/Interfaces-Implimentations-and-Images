We adapted the unboxed array abstraction to support two-dimensional arrays. This adaptation was called UArray2. 

We have correctly implemented the interface for UArray2_T, Bit2_t abstarct data 
structures. We have also correctly implemented sudoku.c and unblackedges.c to 
the best of our knowledge as given by the specifications.
