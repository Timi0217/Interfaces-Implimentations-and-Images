A programming technique that my partner and I have both taken great pains to
incorporate into our programming practice since the start of the term is
incremental and unit testing of functions to prevent cascading errors. We had
both experienced cases in COMP15 where lack of testing each function as we
made them led to hard-to-fix errors that would have been easy to find and 
fix if we had tested our functions as we made them. Explaining this technique
to student midway through COMP15, I would say "TEST EACH FUNCTION AS YOU WRITE
THEM!" That way you know that at any given point in time, the functions in 
your current program work as you want them to. Have a main function for 
testing that calls these functions as they are written, 
and ensures that they perform the operations and return the values that they 
are supposed to.
